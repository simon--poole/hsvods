# PSD

Have fun editing.

## Sprites Dimensions

Currently, the dimensions for icons and thumbs are as follows:

- **Team icons:** 36px by 20px.
- **Tournament/Event Thumbnails:** 70px by 50px.

## GIMP

While PSD can be read by GIMP, it is not recommended to edit the file since GIMP does not support layer groups and may delete layers on save.

It's recommended you modify all PSD files using Photoshop.
